# 🕹️ Caecodux

**Caecodux** is a silly little co-op game about trust, chaos, and slightly questionable navigation skills.  
One player is blindfolded and must rely entirely on their partner’s instructions to escape the maze. Pray that you don't choose a bad teammate.
The other player? Well, good luck giving clear directions when your teammate's an impatient lil goober.  

Perfect for voice chat platforms like **Discord**, where shouting “NO, YOUR OTHER LEFT YOU FUCKING DUMBASS!” is half the fun.
